### Market Research for Miralto

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In 2017, I worked with Miralto, a management consulting company based in San Diego, I did market research for a (top 5) British waste-to-energy client. They are considering whether to enter into the US market because new legislations AB 1826 and SB 1383 passed in California. The product of my research would be a presentation deck and white paper published to convince key stakeholders in Municipalities to agree to a </p>
  
<h3>What I did</h3>  
<p>To make a compelling argument for this new waste hauling and processing technology, I analyzed:</p>
<p>1. Environmental Impact (greenhouse gas emissions)</p>
<p>2. Cost for the customer to haul waste</p>
<p>3. Revenue to the municipality </p>
<p>4. Waste hauling franchise system</p>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>

### Data Analysis for Los Angeles Metro

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>During the fall of 2017, I interned at the Office of Extraordinary Innovations, an innovation lab created by Los Angeles Metro. While my main role is research innovative business models and policy incentives for public transportation, I think I learned the most from the Mobility on Demand project. </p>

<h3>Mobility on Demand</h3>
<p>Having received a $1.35 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration, LA Metro is to collaborate with a Transit Network Company (e.g. Lyft, Uber) to provide first-mile-last-mile transit. People would presumably hop on a ride provided by a TNC and transfer to a Metro bus or rail. I was tasked to find a pilot location or neighborhood within Los Angeles to begin testing this idea.</p>

<h3>What I did</h3>
<p>The project and the grant have 3 priorities. Locations should:</p>
<p><strong>1. Have a high minority population.</strong> To get this information, I used data from the US Census 
<p>2. Have a high low-income population</p>
<p>3. Be insufficiently served by public transit</p>
